            "\n",
            "The controversy stems from the numerous blanks contained in the bicameral conference committee report on the disagreements between the House and the Senate on the House-approved General Appropriations Bill (GAB).

In the House-approved document, the total amount to be supplemented in the budgets of various concerned agencies stood at P104.82 billion. The bicameral conference committee changed the amount to blank, and when the President signed the enrolled copy of the budget, the value was reduced to P87.111 billion, equivalent to a deduction of P17.708 billion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another major discrepancy was on the National Programs for Rice, Corn, High Value Crops Development, Organic Agriculture, Livestock, and Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture. The House approved a budget of P45.848 billion, but the bicam changed the amount to blank. The version of the budget that the President signed allocated only P36.136 billion to the program, a decrease of P9.712 billion.\n",

The budget approved by the House worth P6.272 billion was changed to blank in the bicam, yet when the President signed the GAA, an additional P2.298 billion was allocated to the program.\n",

            "\n",
            "The House receives the NEP, which becomes the basis of the General Appropriations Bill. After the House passes the spending bill, it sends the GAB to the Senate, which passes its own version. Select members of both chambers convene to harmonize disagreeing provisions of their own drafts through the bicameral conference committee.\n",

            "The adjustments discovered, however, raise various questions:\n",

            "\n",
            "Davao City 3rd District Representative Isidro Ungab, who was once chairperson of the appropriations committee, first flagged the blanks during a podcast streamed on the Facebook page of Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte on Saturday, January 18.\n",
            "\n",
            "Former president Rodrigo Duterte, who was a guest on his son’s online show, claimed that this made the 2025 budget invalid.\n",
            "\n",
            "President Marcos fired back at his predecessor on Monday, January 20, accusing Duterte of lying, and insisted that the General Appropriations Act did not contain blanks. The GAA, according to the Office of the Ombudsman, “covers the annual operating requirements of agencies of government” and is “the most comprehensive source of appropriation cover for the budget of the government.”\n",
            "\n",

            "Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel later echoed Ungab’s concerns, confirming on Wednesday, January 22, that the blanks were contained in the report disseminated to the House members on December 11, 2024, just minutes before the plenary voted on its ratification.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Every item in the budget, before it is proposed, before it is submitted, before it is approved by whoever, there should be a number. So the existence of blanks on the budget of the Department of Agriculture is a valid issue,” budget expert Zy-za Suzara said in an interview on Facts First Tonight with Christian Esguerra on Monday, January 20.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We don’t know of course what the reason is because there’s no transparency in the bicam,” she said, referring to the closed-door nature of the deliberations.\n",

            "Abad told Rappler he had never encountered the issue of blanks in the bicam report during his time as a lawmaker, as well as during his six-year stint preparing then-president Benigno Aquino III’s budget. He doubts that issues of legality this time around will prosper in courts.\n",
            "\n",
            "“There is a such thing as doctrine of enrolled bill, which states that an enrolled bill is conclusively presumed enacted in accordance with the procedural constitutional requirements. And if you’re looking for evidence to question that, there is no other evidence beyond the enrolled bill itself,” Abad said.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Supreme Court will no longer interfere if the House or the Senate followed their internal rules of procedure. I think that flows from the principle of independence of branches,” he added.\n",

The event also featured sacred rites conducted by the IP leaders, signifying their united stand against the NPA. This was particularly significant given the historical context of the Balatukan Mountain Complex, where former NPA strongholds, such as Sitio Anaw in Barangay Bantaawan and Sitio Lantad in Kibanban, have been pivotal areas in past conflicts.\n",

            "A separate order aims to halt federal agencies’ DEI programs. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the Constitution by using preferences based on race, gender and sexual orientation. Trump got big cheers at a rally in Washington on Sunday when he said he’d end DEI requirements from the military and schools. The order does not directly address what schools do, though.\n",

            "Trump officials said it’s fitting the order is being delivered on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, as it aims to return to the idea that one day all Americans can be treated on the basis of their character and not by the color of their skin.\n",

            "Trump referred to that in his inauguration speech Monday, saying: “We will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.” He later added: “We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.”\n",

            "Maya Wiley, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Trump’s policies are a step backward. “Dr. King had a dream, and this is his nightmare: the rollback of the work of our civil and human rights coalition over the past 75 years,” she said in a statement.\n",

            "The purpose of the DEI plans was to foster equitable environments in businesses and schools, especially for historically marginalized communities. While researchers say that DEI initiatives stem back to the 1960s, more were launched and expanded in 2020 during increased calls for racial justice.\n",

            "Businesses, including Walmart, McDonalds, and Meta, have already rolled back their diversity policies since the 2024 election.\n"
